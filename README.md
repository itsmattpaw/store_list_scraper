# StoreListScraper

Welcome to my gem! This was designed to pull store location data from a website and provide a CSV export for use as an import file into another geocoding platform. The website is StoreFound.org and is home to over 27,000 business names and addresses. This gem already contains a csv file with a list of all the potential businesses a list can be scraped for. As a user you can: Run a scrape to export a store list, view the list of avaliable businesses, or update the business list.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'store_list_scraper'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install store_list_scraper

## Usage

Run "./bin/exec" and follow the menus to use the program. I would recommend opening up the 'business_list.csv' to identify the company(or companies) you would like to scrape a store list for.
